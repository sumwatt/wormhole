# Svelte-Webpack Project Template

... for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

# Source
https://github.com/sumwatt/svelte-webpack

# Usage

You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sumwatt/svelte-webpack svelte-app
cd svelte-app && npm install
```
wait a few moments for all of the packages to install then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the  web server starts, a browser should open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
